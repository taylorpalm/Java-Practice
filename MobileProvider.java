/*Design a class that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. 
 * It should store the letter of the package the customer has purchased 
 * (A, B, or C) and the number of minutes that were used. It should have 
 * a method that returns the total charges. Demonstrate the class in a 
 * program that asks the user to select a package and enter the number of
 * minutes used. The program should display the total charges.
 * 
 * Modify the program you wrote for Programming Challenge 11 so it also 
 * calculates and displays the amount of money Package A customers would 
 * save if they purchased package B or C, and the amount of money package B 
 * customers would save if they purchased package C. If there would be no savings, 
 * no message should be printed.
